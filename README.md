# 🌟 Welcome!
  
Worst team member, good at making something alone.  
Gonna make 3000 commits fixing grammar issues.  

Seriously, I just make something for myself. Big projects is something rare, because often I don't know how to make them.  
I'm doing everything too long, but the results are pretty good. (this is why I am worst team member, wait decades for me to do something)   

And that's it, I think? Thank you for visiting. 🤍
